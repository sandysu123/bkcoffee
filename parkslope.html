<h4><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/caf%C3%A9-martin-brooklyn-2">CAFE MARTIN</a></h4>

Cafe Martin is a beautiful cafe that is a local staple. It is quite small, but overall the coffee is delicious and 
they are really a pillar in their community. They are charitable towards their community and know many 
of their regular, local customers.
Great spot to enjoy a coffee and hang out with the locals.

<h4><a href="https://gorillacoffee.com/">GORILLA COFFEE</a></h4>
Gorilla Coffee is really a "Brooklyn" coffee shop. The decor is cool bright reds and dark
browns, featuring clothing for sale and graphic arts. They also feature maps on their walls.
Their coffee can be a little strong though, so beware! Also, they sell their coffee beans, so if you
really like the strong coffee taste, bring a bag home!

<h4><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/postmark-cafe-brooklyn">POSTMARK CAFE</a></h4>

What can I say? This is the coziest spot you will find in the BK. Lounge chairs, cushions, a beautiful
reading nook with bookcases and books. This is a gorgeous location! They also host story time during the
week. It's a great spot to bring your kids to and for them to enjoy a fun, reading excursion while you 
relax with a cup of joe.
