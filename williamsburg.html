<h4><a href="https://www.freeholdbrooklyn.com/">FREEHOLD</a></h4>

Freehold is a super hip coffee shop. With a live band in the summer, delicious drinks, and an open
and beautiful space in good weather, no wonder it is the choice spot for young hipsters. The brunch is
also amazing. Come early as it can be really difficult to grab a seat!

<h4><a href="https://sweatshop.coffee/">SWEATSHOP</a></h4>
Sweatshop is an instagrammer's dream. They have that famous wall with the words, 
"Don't Look for Love, Look for Coffee". So many people have taken their pictures out here!
Inside is also a master of interior design as black, white, and beige colors come together to
create a beautiful, open, and surpringsly, bright space. You will see so many students here 
studying or people trying to get work done on their laptops. Grab a seat and enjoy a coffee!

<h4><a href="http://sweetleafcoffee.com/">SWEETLEAF</a></h4>

This is quite a different spot. With dark interiors and rustic wooden pieces, this coffee shop
screams rock n' roll rustic ambiance. Different from the bright and airy places, this cafe prides itself
in it's love for large furniture pieces and vintage wood. They also have stacks of interesting coffee 
magazines and a pool table in the back!
